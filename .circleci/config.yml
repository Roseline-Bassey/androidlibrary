# Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.

  # android: circleci/android@1.0.3

# Define a job to be invoked later in a workflow.
